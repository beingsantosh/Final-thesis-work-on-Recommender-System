Topic - Investigating the accuracy of different distance measures for determining the proximity between the items in movie recommender systems.

Dataset - MovieLens 10K dataset

Abstract- 

Similarity Measurement between datasets has become integral part of all data related fields such as Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. But at the same time, abundance of techniques for the Similarity measurement for instance, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Cosine Similarity, Spearman Rank Correlation etc., have brought uncertainty in implementation of each type. So, to investigate the different distance measures and conclude about its implementation is the primary task of this research.

Additionally, one of the major applications of Similarity Measurement is noticed in Top N Recommender Systems, where distinct explicit and implicit ratings from userâ€™s previous conduct are stored in system and are compared to get the insight about the imminent preferences of the user. 

Therefore, this thesis would utilize the User Based Top N Recommender Systems to investigate the different Similarity Measurement technique and provide a consolidated comparable result. 

Keywords:  Recommender System, Pearson Corelation Coefficient, Cosine Coefficient, Kendall Rank Correlation, Spearman Rank Correlation, Hit Rate.
